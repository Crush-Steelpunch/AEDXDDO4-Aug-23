Once there was a cat who loved to make paper planes. He would sit for hours folding and cutting paper into the perfect shape. He would then take it outside and launch it into the sky and watch it soar. He was the envy of the neighborhood cats as he would make paper plane after paper plane, sending them flying off into the sky. 
He would also spend time decorating his planes with markers and glitter, making them colorful and unique. He even started to make bigger planes that were able to carry small items. One day he made a paper plane that was so big that it was able to carry a piece of cheese from his house to his friend's house across the street. 
The other cats were amazed and soon they were all gathering around to watch him make paper planes and then fly them off. The cat became famous for his ability to make paper planes and soon the entire neighborhood was talking about him and his amazing creations.
